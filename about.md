I'm NJaro, Blue Teamer by profession, Red Teamer by heart, and a python fanatic. I decided to create this blog to motivate myself to do more ctf/hacking challenges, and document my work along the journey, sharing some interesting scripts or thoughts with community.

And BTW (I would feel bad if I did not write this), I use Arch Linux :--)

## Short CV:

- 2019 \- Finished my IT Engineer Thesis (Topic: Analysis of security of different 2FA systems)
- 2020 \- (now) SIEM Security Analyst
- Feb 2022 \- eJPT (eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester)
- Oct 2022 \- my first CTF competition (Hack The Boo 2022)
